# The Hair Affair 

Our web application is a one-stop information portal which allows customers to search for hair salons, find out the services they offer and their respective prices and read reviews by other customers. Customers are also able to view a salonâ€™s available appointments and book their own appointments.

Salons which do not yet have an online presence are able to register an account to be listed on our website to extend their reach and boost sales. They can also tap on our platform to digitalize the scheduling of appointments for their salons. 

### Built with
- Ruby on Rails, Devise gem
- Bootstrap
- PostgreSQL
- JavaScript and jQuery

### Workflow
We identified some issues that hair salon customers may face today:
- booking of appointments are often inconvenient e.g. having to call the salon during work hours and
- lack of trusted customer reviews for hair salons.

- Age range from 18 to 40
- Relatively tech savvy
- Need to book appointment without any hassle 
- Mostly working and have little time to call salons during working hours
